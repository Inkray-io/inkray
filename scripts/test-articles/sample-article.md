# The Future of Decentralized Content Publishing

## Introduction

Welcome to the future of content publishing on blockchain! This article demonstrates **premium content** that is encrypted using advanced cryptographic techniques and stored on decentralized networks.

## Key Features of Inkray Platform

### 🔐 Content-Identity Based Encryption

- Each article encrypted once with unique content ID
- Multiple access methods using same encrypted content
- Zero-knowledge proof systems for privacy

### 🌊 Walrus Integration

- Decentralized blob storage for unlimited content capacity
- Censorship-resistant content distribution
- Efficient storage and retrieval mechanisms

### 🛡️ Seal Encryption Framework

- Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) for access control
- Policy-based decryption using smart contracts
- Multi-credential authentication system

## Access Control Mechanisms

The platform supports **four distinct access methods**:

1. **Publication Owner Access** 👑
   - Direct access using `PublicationOwnerCap`
   - Highest priority access method
   - Always succeeds for content creators

2. **Contributor Access** ✍️
   - Access via contributor verification
   - Fallback method for publication team members
   - Verified through smart contract calls

3. **Platform Subscription** 🎫
   - Time-based access to all premium content
   - Managed through SUI coin payments
   - Automatic renewal and expiration handling

4. **Article NFT Ownership** 🎨
   - Permanent access by owning article NFTs
   - One-time purchase for lifetime access
   - Tradeable on secondary markets

## Technical Implementation

```typescript
// Example: Content encryption with Seal
const contentId = sealClient.generateArticleContentId("premium_article_123");
const encrypted = await sealClient.encryptContent(contentBuffer, {
  contentId: contentId,
  packageId: process.env.PACKAGE_ID,
  threshold: 2,
});

// Upload to Walrus
const uploadResult = await uploadBuffer(encrypted, "premium-content.dat", {
  epochs: 10,
});
```
