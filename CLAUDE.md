# Inkray Decentralized Blogging Platform - Smart Contracts

## Project Overview
- Building a decentralized blogging platform called Inkray on Sui blockchain
- Uses Walrus for decentralized media and article hosting with actual blob object storage
- Uses Seal from Mysten Labs for encrypted paid content gating
- Key features include:
  - Creator tipping mechanism
  - Minting articles as NFTs
  - Subscription model
  - Shared vault system enabling contributor access
  - Backend-managed Walrus uploads with smart contract storage
  - Platform-paid storage with contributor publishing rights

## Architecture Overview

### Content Access Model
- **Free Content**: Unencrypted, stored directly on Walrus
- **Paid Content**: Encrypted with Seal using content-identity based encryption, stored on Walrus as binary data
- **Access Methods (4 ways to decrypt content)**:
  1. **Publication Owner**: Direct access using `PublicationOwnerCap` - cleanest method âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**
  2. **Publication Contributors**: Access via contributor verification (fallback method)
  3. **Platform Subscription**: Time-based access to all paid content via active subscription
  4. **Article NFT Ownership**: Permanent access by owning the article's NFT
  5. **Allowlist**: Explicit permission granted by publication owner

### Publication Management
- **Owner**: Uses `OwnerCap` pattern for administrative control
- **Contributors**: Dynamic list of addresses with publishing rights to shared vaults
- **Content**: Mixed free/paid articles with actual Walrus blob object storage
- **Shared Access**: Contributors can upload and store blobs in publication vaults

## Smart Contract Architecture

### 1. Publication Management (`publication.move`)
**Purpose**: Core publication ownership and contributor management

**Key Features**:
- OwnerCap-based ownership model for secure ownership verification
- Dynamic contributor management with VecSet for efficient operations
- Authorization helpers with dual verification (owner cap + contributor status)
- Comprehensive event emission for off-chain indexing

**Core Functions**:
- `create_publication()` - Creates new publication with owner capability
- `add_contributor()` / `remove_contributor()` - Manage publishing permissions with proper authorization
- `is_contributor()` / `is_owner_with_cap_or_contributor()` - Multi-level authorization checks
- `get_publication_info()` / `get_contributors()` - View functions for metadata access

### 2. Publication Vault (`publication_vault.move`)
**Purpose**: Shared generic blob storage with contributor access

**Key Features**:
- **Shared Object Model**: Multiple contributors can access and store blobs concurrently
- **Generic Blob Storage**: Supports any blob type `B: store` (Walrus, MockBlob, etc.)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Sui Optimization Strategies
- **Object Size Limits**: 250KB max per object
- **Shared Object Model**: Enables concurrent access by multiple contributors
- **Collection Strategy**: 
  - Small collections (â‰¤1000): Use `VecSet<address>` for contributors
  - Large collections: Use `Table<K,V>` for unlimited blob storage scalability
- **Dynamic Fields**: Unlimited storage through Table-based collections
- **Authorization Patterns**: Transaction-level verification for shared object access

### Dependencies Configuration
```toml
[dependencies]
Sui = { git = "https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git", subdir = "crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework", rev = "testnet-v1.53.1" }
Walrus = { git = "https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus.git", rev = "main", subdir = "contracts/walrus" }
```

### Event-Driven Architecture
All contracts emit comprehensive events for off-chain indexing:
- Publication management events
- Article publishing events  
- Subscription and NFT minting events
- Revenue and tipping events
- Storage renewal events

### Gas Efficiency Patterns
- Batch operations where possible
- Cursor-based processing for large datasets
- Event-based off-chain indexing vs on-chain storage
- Table-based collections for unlimited scale

## Key Integrations

- **âœ… Binary Blob Storage**: Proper binary encrypted content on Walrus
- **âœ… Seal Key Server Integration**: Real IBE encryption/decryption working
- **âœ… Content-Identity Encryption**: Hex-encoded content IDs working correctly
- **âœ… Smart Contract Validation**: Owner cap verification integrated with Seal

**Key Features**:
- **Single Encryption**: Each content encrypted once with unique hex-encoded content ID
- **Multiple Access Methods**: Same encrypted content accessible via 5 different policies
- **PublicationOwnerCap Priority**: Cleanest access method using owner capability pattern
- **Credential Fallback Chain**: Automatically tries multiple access methods until one succeeds
- **Binary Data Handling**: Proper Uint8Array handling for encrypted blobs

**Specialized Seal Approve Functions**:
1. **`seal_content_policy::seal_approve_publication_owner`**: **âœ… IMPLEMENTED** - Direct owner access via `PublicationOwnerCap`
2. **`platform_access::seal_approve`**: Validates platform subscriptions
3. **`article_nft::seal_approve`**: Validates article NFT ownership  
4. **`seal_content_policy::seal_approve_publication`**: Validates contributor access via content policy
5. **`seal_content_policy::seal_approve_allowlist`**: Validates allowlist membership

**âœ… Working Encryption Workflow**:
```typescript
// 1. Creator encrypts content with hex-encoded content ID
const contentId = sealClient.generateArticleContentId(`premium_article_${Date.now()}`);
// Generates: 0x61727469636c655f7072656d69756d5f61727469636c655f31373534...

const encrypted = await sealClient.encryptContent(contentBuffer, {
  contentId: contentId,
  packageId: process.env.PACKAGE_ID,
  threshold: 2
});

// 2. Upload encrypted content as BINARY data to Walrus (CRITICAL: not text!)
const uploadResult = await uploadBuffer(encrypted, 'premium-content.dat', { epochs: 10 });
```

**âœ… Working Decryption Workflow**:
```typescript
// 1. Load encrypted blob from Walrus (as binary data)
const encryptedBlob = await downloadBinaryBlob(blobId);

// 2. Publication owner decryption (cleanest method) âœ… WORKING!
const decrypted = await sealClient.decryptContent({
  encryptedData: encryptedBlob,
  contentId: '0x61727469636c655f7072656d69756d5f61727469636c655f31373534...',
  credentials: {
    publicationOwner: { 
      ownerCapId: '0xaffa4db02488f54509f7ac2bb48c907c423d14268c79bd3558ce6be6191d835d',
      publicationId: '0xd10c90aa4626553a948070c3710b7929c7ef6d8719d781ff47df87e73ecd16ee'
    }
    // Fallback credentials also supported:
    // subscription: { id: '0x...', serviceId: '0x...' },
    // nft: { id: '0x...', articleId: '0x...' },
    // contributor: { publicationId: '0x...', contentPolicyId: '0x...' },
    // allowlist: { contentPolicyId: '0x...' }
  },
  packageId: process.env.PACKAGE_ID
});

// 3. Successfully decrypted! âœ…
const content = new TextDecoder().decode(decrypted);
console.log('Decrypted content:', content); // "Custom premium article content..."
```

**Benefits**:
- **Storage Efficient**: Only one encrypted copy per content
- **User Flexible**: Works with whatever credentials users have available
- **Scalable**: Easy to add new access methods without re-encrypting content
- **Maintainable**: Clean separation between encryption and access policies

## Testing Architecture Resolution

### The Challenge
Initially attempted to create actual Walrus `Blob` objects on-chain for testing, which faced architectural limitations.

### The Solution
**Key Insight**: Use mock objects to simulate blob behavior while testing business logic.

**Current Approach**:
- âœ… **MockBlob Implementation**: Custom test blob type with same interface as Walrus blobs
- âœ… **Generic Vault Architecture**: `PublicationVault<B>` supports any blob type with `store`
- âœ… **Comprehensive Testing**: 27/27 tests covering all business logic scenarios
- âœ… **Production Ready**: Architecture ready for actual Walrus blob integration

**Test Coverage**:
- âœ… **Publication Tests**: 13 tests covering creation, contributor management, authorization
- âœ… **Vault Tests**: 3 tests covering shared vault creation, renewal system, management
- âœ… **Blob Storage Tests**: 7 tests covering store/get/remove operations with authorization
- âœ… **Content Registry Tests**: 4 tests covering article publishing with blob integration

### Lessons Learned
1. **Generic Architecture**: Design contracts to work with any blob type, not just Walrus
2. **Mock Testing**: Use representative mock objects to test business logic
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Focus on contract logic, not external system integration
4. **Production Readiness**: Architecture is ready to swap MockBlob for actual Walrus blobs

## Key Learnings & Implementation Notes

### Shared Object Patterns
- Shared objects enable multiple contributors to access vaults simultaneously
- Authorization must be checked in every function that modifies shared state
- Use `transfer::share_object()` during creation for shared access model

### Walrus Integration Approach
- **File Uploads**: Walrus blobs are created off-chain through file uploads, not on-chain
- **Backend Integration**: Platform backend handles Walrus API interactions
- **Smart Contract References**: Contracts work with blob IDs and metadata, not blob creation
- **Testing Strategy**: Focus on business logic that doesn't require on-chain blob creation
- **Key Insight**: Attempted on-chain blob creation for testing was fundamentally incorrect

### Table-Based Storage
- Use `Table<u256, T>` for unlimited storage capacity
- Key by `blob_id` for efficient lookups
- Supports concurrent access in shared object model

### Testing Patterns
- **Focused Testing**: Test only functionality that doesn't require on-chain blob creation
- **Shared objects**: Use `take_shared()` and `return_shared()` patterns
- **Multi-transaction scenarios**: For contributor workflows
- **Proper object lifecycle management**: Prevents inventory errors
- **Walrus Limitation Discovery**: External packages cannot manage Walrus System lifecycle
- **System Abandonment Issue**: `system.destroy_for_testing()` is `public(package)` only

### Authorization Security
- Every blob operation verifies contributor/owner status
- OwnerCap pattern maintained for administrative functions
- Event emission for audit trails and off-chain indexing
