# Inkray Decentralized Blogging Platform - Smart Contracts

## Project Overview
- Building a decentralized blogging platform called Inkray on Sui blockchain
- Uses Walrus for decentralized media and article hosting with actual blob object storage
- Uses Seal from Mysten Labs for encrypted paid content gating
- Key features include:
  - Creator tipping mechanism
  - Minting articles as NFTs
  - Subscription model
  - Shared vault system enabling contributor access
  - Backend-managed Walrus uploads with smart contract storage
  - Platform-paid storage with contributor publishing rights

## Architecture Overview

### Content Access Model
- **Free Content**: Unencrypted, stored directly on Walrus
- **Paid Content**: Encrypted with Seal, stored on Walrus
- **Access Methods**: 
  1. Mint article as NFT (permanent access)
  2. Platform subscription (access to all paid content)

### Publication Management
- **Owner**: Uses `OwnerCap` pattern for administrative control
- **Contributors**: Dynamic list of addresses with publishing rights to shared vaults
- **Content**: Mixed free/paid articles with actual Walrus blob object storage
- **Shared Access**: Contributors can upload and store blobs in publication vaults

## Smart Contract Architecture

### 1. Publication Management (`publication.move`)
**Purpose**: Core publication ownership and contributor management

**Key Features**:
- OwnerCap-based ownership model
- Dynamic contributor management (add/remove contributors)
- Authorization helpers for content publishing
- Event emission for off-chain indexing

**Core Functions**:
- `create_publication()` - Creates new publication with owner capability
- `add_contributor()` / `remove_contributor()` - Manage publishing permissions
- `is_contributor()` / `is_authorized_with_cap()` - Authorization checks

### 2. Publication Vault (`publication_vault.move`)
**Purpose**: Shared Walrus blob storage with contributor access

**Key Features**:
- **Shared Object Model**: Multiple contributors can access and store blobs
- **Actual Blob Storage**: Stores Walrus `MockBlob` objects, not just references
- **Authorization Control**: Verifies contributor/owner status before blob operations
- **Efficient renewal system** with RenewCap for platform-managed renewals
- **Table-based storage**: Unlimited blob capacity using `Table<u256, MockBlob>`

**Core Functions**:
- `create_vault()` - Creates shared vault accessible by contributors
- `store_blob()` - Contributors/owners can store actual blob objects with metadata
- `get_blob()` - Retrieve stored blob objects for content serving
- `remove_blob()` - Owner-only blob removal capability
- `update_renewal_epoch()` - Platform renewal using RenewCap
- `needs_renewal()` - Check if renewal is required

**Shared Vault Architecture**:
- Vault created as shared object via `transfer::share_object()`
- Contributors access vault directly with authorization checks
- Platform manages renewals via RenewCap without blocking contributor access
- Backend uploads to Walrus, then stores blob objects in shared vaults

### 3. Content Registry (`content_registry.move`)
**Purpose**: Article metadata and integrated blob storage management

**Key Features**:
- **Integrated Blob Storage**: Automatically stores blob objects during article publishing
- **Enhanced Metadata**: Includes blob size, encoding type, and encryption status
- **Author authorization**: Contributors and owners can publish with proper verification
- **Vault Integration**: Works with shared vault model for multi-contributor access
- **Backend Upload Support**: Accepts blob metadata from backend Walrus uploads

**Core Functions**:
- `publish_article()` - Contributors publish with full blob metadata integration
- `publish_article_as_owner()` - Owner publishing with same blob storage integration
- `update_article()` - Update article metadata (blob storage remains immutable)
- **New Parameters**: `blob_size`, `encoding_type` for comprehensive blob management

**Backend Integration Workflow**:
1. User uploads file via frontend
2. Backend uploads to Walrus, receives blob object
3. Backend calls `publish_article()` with complete blob metadata
4. Smart contract stores blob object in shared vault and creates article

### 4. Platform Access Control (`platform_access.move`)
**Purpose**: Seal integration for encrypted premium content

**Key Features**:
- Platform-wide subscription management
- Time-based access control using Sui Clock
- Seal approval functions for content decryption
- Subscription pricing and duration management

**Core Functions**:
- `subscribe_to_platform()` - Create platform subscription
- `seal_approve_platform_subscription()` - Validate subscription for Seal
- `is_subscription_active()` - Check subscription status
- Service configuration and fee management

**Seal Integration**:
- Uses Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) with BLS12-381 curve
- Threshold encryption (t-out-of-n key servers)
- Access policies defined in Move smart contracts
- Session keys for reduced wallet confirmations

### 5. Article NFT (`article_nft.move`)
**Purpose**: Mintable NFTs for permanent article access

**Key Features**:
- NFT minting for paid articles only
- Automatic premium content access for holders
- Royalty system and marketplace integration
- Display metadata for wallets/marketplaces

**Core Functions**:
- `mint_article_nft()` - Mint NFT for permanent access
- `seal_approve_article_nft()` - Validate NFT ownership for Seal
- Display configuration with metadata templates
- Price and royalty management

**NFT Access Pattern**:
- Only paid articles can be minted as NFTs
- NFT ownership grants permanent access to encrypted content
- Royalties distributed on secondary sales
- Platform fee collection on minting

### 6. Platform Economics (`platform_economics.move`)
**Purpose**: Creator monetization and revenue management

**Key Features**:
- Creator treasury management per publication
- Direct article tipping functionality
- Revenue tracking and withdrawal system
- Platform fee collection and distribution

**Core Functions**:
- `create_creator_treasury()` - Initialize creator revenue account
- `tip_article()` - Direct tipping to article authors
- `withdraw_funds()` - Creator revenue withdrawal
- Platform fee management and collection

## Technical Implementation Details

### Sui Optimization Strategies
- **Object Size Limits**: 250KB max per object
- **Shared Object Model**: Enables concurrent access by multiple contributors
- **Collection Strategy**: 
  - Small collections (≤1000): Use `VecSet<address>` for contributors
  - Large collections: Use `Table<K,V>` for unlimited blob storage scalability
- **Dynamic Fields**: Unlimited storage through Table-based collections
- **Authorization Patterns**: Transaction-level verification for shared object access

### Dependencies Configuration
```toml
[dependencies]
Sui = { git = "https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git", subdir = "crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework", rev = "testnet-v1.53.1" }
Walrus = { git = "https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus.git", rev = "main", subdir = "contracts/walrus" }
```

### Event-Driven Architecture
All contracts emit comprehensive events for off-chain indexing:
- Publication management events
- Article publishing events  
- Subscription and NFT minting events
- Revenue and tipping events
- Storage renewal events

### Gas Efficiency Patterns
- Batch operations where possible
- Cursor-based processing for large datasets
- Event-based off-chain indexing vs on-chain storage
- Table-based collections for unlimited scale

## Key Integrations

### Walrus Storage Integration
**New Architecture: Backend Upload + Smart Contract Storage**
- **Backend Upload Process**: Platform backend uploads files to Walrus via web API
- **Blob Object Storage**: Smart contracts store actual `MockBlob` objects with metadata
- **Shared Vault Access**: Contributors can store blobs in shared publication vaults
- **Platform-Paid Storage**: Backend handles all Walrus payments and storage costs
- **Integrated Workflow**: Upload → Backend processing → Smart contract storage
- **Authorization Control**: Contributors verified before blob storage operations
- **Table-Based Scaling**: Unlimited blob storage using `Table<u256, MockBlob>`

**Mock Blob Structure** (for testing, will be replaced with actual Walrus integration):
```move
public struct MockBlob has store, drop {
    blob_id: u256,
    size: u64,
    encoding_type: String,
    is_encrypted: bool,
}
```

### Seal Encryption Integration
- Multiple access patterns: subscriptions, NFTs, allowlists
- IBE-based encryption with Move access policies
- `seal_approve*` functions for content gating
- Session key support for UX optimization

## Security Considerations
- Capability-based access control (OwnerCap pattern)
- Field access restrictions through module boundaries
- Event-based audit trails for all operations
- Proper authorization checks for all state changes

## Key Learnings & Implementation Notes

### Shared Object Patterns
- Shared objects enable multiple contributors to access vaults simultaneously
- Authorization must be checked in every function that modifies shared state
- Use `transfer::share_object()` during creation for shared access model

### Walrus Integration Approach
- Backend handles file uploads and Walrus API interactions
- Smart contracts store blob objects with full metadata
- Platform pays all storage costs, simplifying user experience
- Mock structures used for testing, ready for actual Walrus integration

### Table-Based Storage
- Use `Table<u256, T>` for unlimited storage capacity
- Key by `blob_id` for efficient lookups
- Supports concurrent access in shared object model

### Testing Patterns
- Shared objects require `take_shared()` and `return_shared()` patterns
- Multi-transaction scenarios for contributor workflows
- Proper object lifecycle management prevents inventory errors

### Authorization Security
- Every blob operation verifies contributor/owner status
- OwnerCap pattern maintained for administrative functions
- Event emission for audit trails and off-chain indexing
